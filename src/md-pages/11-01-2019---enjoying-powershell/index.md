# Enjoying Powershell

<p>
    Last week I have a task that needs Batch script to automate deletion of many unused files from productions.
</p>
<p>
    Honestly I'm not too insterested in using Batch or Powershell script as I'm always make anything out of C#.
    But setting up the environment to run my C# script to use in production will likely rejected by Infra.
    So I force myself to use Powershell and format my code like-a-c#. ðŸ˜„

    Whenever I learn some new language, Array type is a must in the first-try.
